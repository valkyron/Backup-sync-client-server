Out of this about 85% is carpet grade wool, 5% apparel grade and remaining 10% coarse grade wool which is underutilized. This 10% coarse grade wool is in the range of 32.5 microns and above in diameter. At present, wool industry provides employment in the organised wool sector to about 12 lakh persons, with an additional 20 lakh persons associated in the sheep rearing and farming.\r\nsector.\r\nThe coarse wool is not sought after because of its coarse diameter, presence of medullation, inferior quality of the product and difficulties during the processing. Though at the cottage level, certain amount of this wool is being spun into yarn by hand spinning, it suffers with many deficiencies in terms of yarn quality and heavy droppage of 50% - 60% on the original wool reducing the yarn yield to 40% - 50%. This creates a high wastage of the fibre that is not used and destroyed resulting ecological damage and national loss. Therefore, it is Prudent to utilise such unusable coarse wool into technical textiles Value added products such as Building Material as Insulator & acoustic in Building as a Green Building Materials. In this proposal, it is proposed to explore the possibility to utilize coarse wool from different part of India as insulation material & acoustic for building/construction, where we can utilise wool properties such Thermal Insulation, low embodied energy, self-extinguishing which makes coarse grade wool a sustainable material option for using as insulator & acoutic for building as compared to other available products like rock-wool, glass-wool, etc.", "justification_of_project": "The coarse wool is not sought after because of its coarse diameter, presence of medullation, inferior quality of the product and difficulties during the processing.

In the building sector, sheep wool may have potential as it meets the requirements of green building components because it is an eco-friendly, renewable, and totally recyclable material. If used instead of common insulation materials (e.g., fiberglass, rock wool, polyurethane foam, polystyrene), sheep wool offers significant benefits for sustainability such as a reduction in the production costs for new insulating materials and in environmental pollution as it has less embodied energy than other materials.

The industry utilizes the raw material in the form of both natural and synthetic fibres. Natural fibres are used extensively in the textile market because of their natural and comfort feeling as well as a conscious environmental awareness among the consumers. These natural textile fibres come from three sources viz; plant origin (bast, coir, jute etc); mineral origin (asbestos fibres); and animal origin (wool, Pashmina, angora etc).\r\nThe fibre of animal origin grows from animal skin with the primary objective of protecting them from deleterious effects of heat and cold. Among all the animal fibres, wool is a predominant one (Karim, 2009) growing from sheep skin and is used in both the woolen and worsted sectors. Besides wool, the other group of natural fibres obtained from certain animals of goat, rabbit and camel families, rarer than more commonly used fibres and valued for some desirable properties is known as specialty hair fibres (Wani et al., 2010). The attributes and characteristics which give value to these fibres are smooth and glossy surface, their scarcity, rarity, pleasing hand, high price and their elegant and exclusive nature. Examples include Pashmina, angora, mohair, yak and camel hair.\r\nPashmina is one of the speciality hair fibres and is considered as a prince of speciality hair fibres. It is utilized for the development of aesthetic products like knitwear and woven fabrics. In India, majority of Pashmina is utilized for preparation of shawls in Kashmir valley which is mostly hand spun and hand woven. Processing of Pashmina is an age old practice in Kashmir valley and is known for its quality throughout the world. Traditional method of processing has given these Pashmina products a royal status (Yaqoob et al, 2012). The Geographical Indication Registry, Gol has also awarded GIS to Kashmiri Hand spun Handmade Pashmina Shawls under the name Kashmiri Pashmina. Pashmina industry in Kashmir is an export oriented industry worth millions of dollars. However, the absence of quality standards for Pashmina and Pashmina products has rendered this trade open to the exploitation by unscrupulous traders at the cost of genuine Pashmina products.\r\nDue to restricted availability and high prices, adulteration of Pashmina is becoming a common practice by unscrupulous manufacturers. Sheep wool is one of the cheaper substitutes for adulteration with specialty animal fiber, primarily because of its low cost and adequate availability and secondarily as surface properties and chemical composition of wool matches with other specialty fibers in one way or the other. Moreover, ultrafine/superfine merino wool of 14-16 μm and OPTIM of 15-16 μm developed by Australia is also available in the market for falsification of Pashmina fabrics. Such a problem, therefore, calls for a reliable test methods to differentiate cashmere from other animal fibers to confront adulteration.", "justification_of_project": "Pashmina is one of the speciality hair fibres, utilized for the development of woven products (shawls, stoles, mufflers etc.) in Kashmir valley adapting traditional tools and techniques which is mostly hand spun and hand woven.

However, the absence of quality standards for pashmina and pashmina products has rendered this trade open to the exploitation by some traders and manufactures at the cost of genuine Pashmina products.

Furthermore, local geography and climate of Changthang determines which pastures are available in which season. Movement of nomads typically goes between the winter dwellings in the lowlands near Indus river banks and vicinity of their villages and summer dwellings in mountain pastures.
